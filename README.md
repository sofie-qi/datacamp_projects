### SQL Projects

[American Baby Name Trends](https://github.com/sofie-qi/Datacamp-Projects/blob/main/Analyzing%20American%20Baby%20Name%20Trends/notebook.ipynb)

> This is a SQL project I completed on Datacamp to analyze American baby name trends. The dataset records 101 years of American baby names, including year, first name, and the total number of babies given that first name in that year.

> The queries involve categorization, ranking techniques, subquery, and common table expression to analyze the name trends from different perspectives.

[Analyze International Debt Statistics](https://github.com/sofie-qi/Datacamp-Projects/blob/main/Analyze%20International%20Debt%20Statistics%202/notebook.ipynb)

> It's not that we humans only take debts to manage our necessities. A country may also take debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending is one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable lives. The World Bank is the organization that provides debt to countries. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. We are going to find the answers to questions like:

* What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
* Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
* What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

### Python Projects
[Card Game ](https://github.com/sofie-qi/card-game-python.git)

> This is a simple game I designed using Python during my back-end training at NuCamp. This game allows you to play card battle with the computer. You are allowed to select your card and the computer's card is selected randomly. You are allowed to replay the game until you lose 10 times. The code involves loop, list, function and etc.

### R Projects

[Health Insurance Cross Sale Prediction](https://github.com/sofie-qi/insurance-cross-sale-prediction.git)

> Just like medical insurance, there is vehicle insurance where every year customer needs to pay a premium of certain amount to insurance provider company so that in case of unfortunate accident by the vehicle, the insurance provider company will provide a compensation (called ‘sum assured’) to the customer.
Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimize its business model and revenue.
